\title{WOETable}
\usage{
WOETable(X, Y, valueOfGood = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The categorical variable stored as factor for which WOE Table is to be computed.}

\item{Y}{The actual 1/0 flags for the binary response variable. It can take values of either 1 or 0, where 1 represents the 'Good' or 'Events' while 0 represents 'Bad' or 'Non-Events'.}

\item{valueOfGood}{The value in Y that is used to represent 'Good' or the occurence of the event of interest. Defaults to 1.
\itemize{
  \item CAT. The groups (levels) of the categorical X variable for which WOE is to be calculated.
  \item GOODS. The total number of "Goods" or "Events" in respective group.
  \item BADS. The total number of "Bads" or "Non-Events" in respective group.
  \item TOTAL. The total number of observations in respective group.
  \item PCT_G. The Percentage of 'Goods' or 'Events' accounted for by respective group.
  \item PCT_B. The Percentage of 'Bads' or 'Non-Events' accounted for by respective group.
  \item WOE. The computed weights of evidence(WOE) for respective group. The WOE values can be used in place of the actual group itself, thereby producing a 'continuous' alternative.
  \item IV. The information value contributed by each group in the X. The sum of IVs is the total information value of the categorical X variable.
}}
}
\value{
The WOE table with the respective weights of evidence for each group and the IV's.
}
\description{
Compute the WOETable that shows the Weights Of Evidence (WOE) for each group and respeective Information Values (IVs).
}
\details{
For a given actual for a Binary Y variable and a categorical X variable stored as factor, the WOE table is generated with calculated WOE's and IV's
