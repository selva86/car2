\usage{
sensitivity(actuals, predictedScores, threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{actuals}{The actual binary flags for the response variable. It can take values of either 1 or 0, where 1 represents the 'Good' or 'Events' while 0 represents 'Bad' or 'Non-Events'.}

\item{predictedScores}{The prediction probability scores for each observation.}

\item{threshold}{If predicted value is above the threshold, it will be considered as an event (1), else it will be a non-event (0). Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
The sensitivity of the given binary response actuals and predicted probability scores, which is, the number of observations with the event AND predicted to have the event divided by the nummber of observations with the event.
}
\description{
Calculate the sensitivity for a given logit model.
}
\details{
For a given binary response actuals and predicted probability scores, sensitivity is defined as number of observations with the event AND predicted to have the event divided by the number of observations with the event. It can be used as an indicator to gauge how sensitive is your model in detecting the occurence of events, especially when you are not so concerned about predicting the non-events as true.
